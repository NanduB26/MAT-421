        "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide and remains a critical health concern for women. Early detection is essential for improving survival rates, making accurate diagnosis a top priority. While traditional diagnostic methods such as mammography and biopsies are effective, they can also be costly and time-consuming. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach by analyzing medical data to support early detection, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and reduce the likelihood of errors.  \n",

        "This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. By implementing advanced ML algorithms, the study aims to improve classification accuracy and identify key factors that contribute to breast cancer diagnosis."

        "Machine learning has been widely applied in breast cancer classification, with models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Deep Learning improving diagnostic accuracy. Street, Wolberg, and Mangasarian (1993) pioneered this approach by introducing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset and using Logistic Regression and SVM to classify tumors based on cell features.\n",

        "Further studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of SVM, with Osareh (2010) finding that non-linear kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF), outperform linear SVM in classification accuracy. Tree-based models have also been explored, with Nagi and Arora (2013) showing that Random Forest provides robust feature selection and reduces overfitting compared to single Decision Trees.\n",

        "Deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been investigated for breast cancer detection.

        "While these studies highlight the strengths of various machine learning techniques, a comprehensive comparison of multiple models on standardized datasets is still needed. This project aims to fill this gap by evaluating Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to determine the most effective model for tumor classification."
